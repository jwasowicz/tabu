# TABU Game
TABU is a social game in which two teams alternate guessing passwords transmitted by a player who cannot use forbidden words or gestures. The original game (eTABU) from which I took inspiration is only available for phones, so I wanted to take on this challenge and create an app that can be played on all devices!

# Note
The design is created mainly for mobile applications, but we can also use the application on the desktop.

## Technologies I've used:
Typescript + React + Redux

## What I'm planning to add:

    - Dynamic data (cards will not be repeated, the user will be able to add their own categories) ❌
    - Add sound effects ✅
    - Create components for each of start icons ❌
    - Add animations and improve existed ❌
    - Create a component that clearly explains the rules of the game ❌
    - Add ability to change interface language and cards ✅
    - Add more cards and categories ❌
